# Dotfiles

BTW, I use Arch

Okay, okay that's not what this project is about.

More of really just a place for me to leave the configurations that I make to my system in the case that I completely bork it or decide to switch to a new operating system (Something that I do end up do pretty often).

Other than that, feel free to use this on your system as well.

The current design language is to look "as close to a TUI as possible" aka. a terminal user interface. It's also fairly barebones without much of anything eccentric to make it super custom. I just think it's easy to use and gets the job done.

# Current Setup

- hyprland
  - I don't use it's eye candy features for the most part though it may change in the future. Mainly it's just that it's popular and actively developed.
- fuzzel
  - A simple minimal runner that I use. I was originally going to go with rofi but I was having issues with it flickering.
- waybar
  - This is basically the default top bar that most people use. I just took the default configuration that it comes with and made it monotone.
- neovim
  - I just threw on LazyVim for better language support though it's not necessary.
